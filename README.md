### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on an interactive data science web dashboard to help with market research. With two masters in Economics and two awards in the market research field, I hope to benefit others while demonstrating my skill :)

ğŸ“« You can reach me on LinkedIn, I'm quite active there and also promote videos of my work there. Link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/warnerdejong/

ğŸ‘ˆ There, you see a number of coding skills I have. My data science bread-and-butter languages are Python and SQL so far.

ğŸ”­ Currently looking for a data scientist opportunity, to help you in making data decisions, to learn together and to laugh. Do reach out to me if you want to talk! â˜•â˜•
