### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on an interactive data science web dashboard to help with market research, with two masters in Economics and two awards in this research field, I hope to benefit others while demonstrating my skill :)

ğŸ‘ˆ There, you see a number of coding skills I have. My data science bread-and-butter languages are Python and SQL so far.

ğŸ”­ Currently looking for a data scientist opportunity, to help you in making data decisions, to learn together and to laugh. Do reach out to me if you want to talk! â˜•â˜•
